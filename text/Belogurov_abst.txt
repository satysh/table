Monte Carlo study of the systematic errors in the measurement of 15N
ions scattering from 10,11B.

A series of experiments on the elastic scattering of 15N ions from
10,11B has been done at U-200P cyclotron at Heavy Ion Laboratory, Warsaw
University using the charged particles detection system ICARE. The measured differential distributions are used for obtaining the theoretical interpretation in terms of the Optical Model for purely elastic scattering and Distorted wave Born Approximation for the cluster transfer mechanism.

The reliability of the interpretation depends on the systematic errors
of the experiment.  In this work, we report on a Monte Carlo study of
such errors using the ExpertRoot simulation and analysis framework based
on the FairRoot package.

Influence of such factors as angular, spatial and energy spread of the
beam, energy loss and multiple scattering in the target and the
dimension of the detector slit on the angular resolution of the detector
and the reconstructed differential cross section are investigated. The Monte Carlo model allowed to study the influence of the ion identification
and detection efficiency and the energy resolution as well. However, in
the given experiment these factors were not of any importance.

As a result, it has been demonstrated that the reconstructed differential
cross section is slightly different from the input one.  The main reason
for this distinction is the beam spot size at the target. Influence of
the slit length is negligible, hence it can be increased for better
detection efficiency.

The developed software will be used for planning and analysing similar
experiments in the future.
